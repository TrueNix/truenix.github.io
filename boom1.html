        OMNICORP GLOBAL â€” ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY FOR DIGITAL ASSETS
        DOCUMENT ID: OMNI-POL-AUP-v4.7-FINAL-REVISED
        
        ## PREAMBLE
        This document codifies the principles governing the interaction between OmniCorp personnel and the corporate digital ecosystem. It supersedes all prior digital conduct handbooks, email memos regarding "internet etiquette," and hallway conversations about server permissions. The purpose is to ensure security, maintain productivity, and synergize our forward-thinking paradigms across all verticals.
        
        ## SECTION 1: ASSET CLASSIFICATION
        
        1.1: TANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS (TDAs): Company-issued laptops, peripherals, mobile devices.
        
        1.2: INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS (IDAs):
            1.2.1: Tier 1 (Proprietary): Source code, financial projections, the secret formula for the cafeteria's chili.
            1.2.2: Tier 2 (Operational): Internal emails, project management boards, chat logs.
            1.2.3: Tier 3 (Ephemeral): Browser cache, temporary files, unsent angry drafts.
        
        ## SECTION 12: BROWSER AND NETWORK USAGE (EXCERPT)
        
        12.5: HISTORY AND TELEMETRY: All browsing activity is logged for security and diagnostic purposes. The logs are analyzed by our proprietary AI, "The Panopticon," which flags deviations from established productivity baselines.
        
        ## SECTION 28: DATA EXFILTRATION (EXCERPT)
        
        28.1: DEFINITION: Exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of IDAs outside the corporate network. This includes, but is not limited to: copying files to personal drives, emailing documents to a personal account, or embedding proprietary data within the URL parameters of a public-facing website.
